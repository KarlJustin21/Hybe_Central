                <h3>Background and History</h3>

                <p>HYBE Central was born out of a school project, envisioned by a group of passionate fans who wanted to combine their love for Hallyu<br>
                    culture with their learning journey in web development. As students delving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, we sought to<br>
                    create a platform that not only showcased our technical skills but also served a meaningful purpose for the global fan community.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Inspiration and motivation behind HYBE Central</h3>

                <p>
                    Our inspiration stemmed from the desire to build a comprehensive and engaging fan site that could cater to both new and long-time<Br>
                    fans of HYBE Entertainment. We noticed a gap in the online fan experience and wanted to create a space where fans could easily access<br>
                    the latest news, exclusive content, and connect with others who share their passion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The motivation behind HYBE Central was twofold: to develop a high-quality website as a testament to our growing skills in web<br>
                    development and to provide a valuable resource for the vibrant Hallyu fandom. Through this project, we aim to foster a deeper<br>
                    connection between fans and their favorite artists while also enhancing our own learning and expertise in creating dynamic, user-<br>
                    friendly web applications.

                    taking up space on your personal devices. These galleries are private, meaning only you can view them. This feature is<br>
                    designed to enhance your fan experience by giving you easy access to the content you love, all in one place. As we continue to<br>
                    improve our platform, we aim to add more customization options to make your galleries even more unique and personal.

                    HYBE Central fosters a sense of community by allowing fans to engage through comments and likes on various posts. While<br>
                    we currently offer these basic interaction tools, we also provide redirect links to external forums and community posts,<br>
                    helping you connect with broader fan communities outside our website. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce chat<br>
                    functionalities and profile personalization features, making it easier for you to interact and form meaningful connections with<br>
                    fellow fans. Our goal is to continuously improve and expand these features to create a more interactive and personalized<br>
